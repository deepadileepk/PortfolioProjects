# SQL - COVID-19 Project
The complete COVID-19 dataset is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained
by Our World in Data -https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths which is updated daily throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this data analytical project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL. 
The project involved downloading and integrating diverse datasets from reputable sources to create a robust and up-to-date repository. 
By employing SQL queries and data manipulation techniques, I delved into the dataset to explore infection rates, mortality trends, and the impact of various factors on the spread of the virus. 
The objective of this project was to gain actionable insights that can aid in understanding the pandemic's dynamics.

The tool that accompanied this research was AZURE DATA STUDIO and AZURE SQL Server Database.
