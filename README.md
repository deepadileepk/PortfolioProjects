**SQL - COVID-19 Project** 

The complete COVID-19 dataset is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained
by Our World in Data -https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths which is updated daily throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this data analytical project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data using SQL. 
The project involved downloading and integrating diverse datasets from reputable sources to create a robust and up-to-date repository. 
By employing SQL queries and data manipulation techniques, I delved into the dataset to explore infection rates, mortality trends, and the impact of various factors on the spread of the virus. 
The objective of this project was to gain actionable insights that can aid in understanding the pandemic's dynamics.

The tool that accompanied this research was AZURE DATA STUDIO and AZURE SQL Server Database.


**SQL Housing Project**

Dataset used for this project was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data

In this data cleaning project, I utilized SQL to preprocess and clean a housing dataset -identified and handled missing values, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. Through data profiling and validation using SQL queries, I resolved inconsistencies and discrepancies in the data.

The tool that accompanied this research was AZURE DATA STUDIO and AZURE SQL Server Database.

*** Fortune 500 Analysis**

Dataset used for this analysis included a fictious dataset, at the onset I explored different columns to understand industry wise, company wise, revenue wise, tenure wise and group them by the above mentioned categories.
